For toggling the display of hidden directories when opening a directory in KDE Plasma (for example when trying to open a directory below .ansible from VS Code), press `<crtl>h`
Note: You will have to scroll the list with the files and directories to the top because the list will not automatically scroll up after the hidden files and directories are shown.
